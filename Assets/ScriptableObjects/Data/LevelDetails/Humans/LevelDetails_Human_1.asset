  _levelDescription: In the peaceful land of Brighthaven, nestled deep within the
    lush forest, life has always been serene. However, that tranquility is shattered
    when a Beastmen horde, led by centaurs and  goblins, launches a surprise attack.

    reclaim Brighthaven from the enemy. Will you be able to protect the village and
    push back the first wave of invaders?
