  _levelName: 'IV: Ambush in the Duskwood'
  _levelDescription: After repelling the siege at Highwall Keep, intelligence reports
    suggest that a significant Beastmen warband is moving through the dense Duskwood
    Forest. This presents a rare opportunity to strike a decisive blow. Leading a
    handpicked force of elite Stormguard soldiers, you must set up a series of ambushes
    to catch the Beastmen off guard and cripple their forces. Success will greatly
    diminish the Beastmen threat in the region.
