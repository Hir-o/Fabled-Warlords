  _levelName: 'II: The Battle of Ironridge'
  _levelDescription: Following the defense of Emberwood, the Beastmen forces have
    regrouped and set their sights on Ironridge, a strategically vital mining area
    rich in resources. With the Kingdom's army stretched thin, you must utilize the
    rugged terrain and fortified defenses to your advantage. Defend the mines and
    the town's people from the Beastmen's relentless onslaught. Success here will
    ensure a steady supply of iron for Stormguard's war effort.
