  _levelName: 'II: Liberation of Graywatch'
  _levelDescription: Graywatch, once a proud and bustling land, now lies in the iron
    grip of the beastmen. After their surprise attack on Brighthaven, the enemy forces
    have fortified their hold on this key settlement. As the Commander of Stormguard,
    you must gather your troops and launch a counteroffensive to liberate Graywatch.
    The beastmen, led by cunning goblin tacticians, relentless centaur raiders, and
    flying harpies, will not surrender easily. Success in this battle will mark the
    first major victory for Stormguard and ignite hope for the liberation of the
    entire region.
