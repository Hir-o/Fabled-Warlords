  _levelName: 'III: Siege of Highwall Keep'
  _levelDescription: Highwall Keep stands as the last line of defense before the
    heartlands of Stormguard. The Beastmen, now bolstered by powerful cyclops and
    swift wolf riders, are determined to breach its formidable walls. As the Commander,
    it's your duty to hold the keep at all costs. With limited reinforcements and
    dwindling supplies, you must employ every tactic and strategy at your disposal
    to withstand the siege and prevent the fall of this fortress.
