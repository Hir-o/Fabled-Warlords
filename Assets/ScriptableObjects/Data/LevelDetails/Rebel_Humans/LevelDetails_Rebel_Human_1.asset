  _levelName: 'XVII: The Uprising'
  _levelDescription: Greenhaven Vale, once a peaceful haven under the rule of Stormguard,
    now becomes the spark that ignites rebellion. The people, tired of being left
    vulnerable to Beastmen raids, rally under a banner of resistance. With nothing
    left to lose, former soldiers and villagers alike rise up to seize control of
    the vale. The land that once symbolized harmony now stands as the first battleground
    in a fight for freedom.
