  _levelName: 'XVIII: Siege of Stonespire'
  _levelDescription: "The walls of Stonespire have stood for centuries, a symbol
    of Stormguard\u2019s strength and authority. But now, those same walls are a

    the rebels prepare for their boldest move yet: to lay siege to the fortress that
    once protected them. The clash at the gates will test their resolve\u2014can
    they topple the empire they once served?"
