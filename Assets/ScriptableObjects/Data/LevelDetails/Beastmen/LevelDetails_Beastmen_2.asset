  _levelName: 'VIII: Defending the Redstone Valley'
  _levelDescription: After the initial invasion, the Primordials press their attack
    through Redstone Valley, aiming to subdue the Beastmen tribes scattered across
    the region. As chieftain, your mission is to rally these tribes by freeing them
    from the Primordials' grasp. The open terrain offers little in the way of natural
    defenses, so you must rely on your tactical prowess to outmaneuver the enemy
    and unite the tribes. Success will solidify your forces and strengthen your position
    against the Primordial threat
