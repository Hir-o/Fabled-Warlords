  _levelName: 'VII: Defending the Bloodstone Pass'
  _levelDescription: After the initial invasion, the Primordials press their attack
    through Bloodstone Pass, a narrow and strategic passage that serves as a critical
    defense point for the Beastmen. With the Primordials' relentless assault, you
    must hold the pass and prevent their forces from advancing further into Beastmen
    territory. Employ the natural terrain to create chokepoints and ambushes, ensuring
    the Primordials are halted in their tracks.
