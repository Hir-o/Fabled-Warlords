  _levelName: 'IX: Siege of the Stonefort '
  _levelDescription: The Stonefort stands as a temporary refuge, buying precious
    time for the Beastmen to prepare for a mass evacuation to safer lands. As the
    Primordials close in, your mission is to defend the fort against relentless attacks,
    holding the line until your people are ready to leave. Though the fort's fall
    is inevitable, every moment you hold it counts. Protect your kin, secure their
    escape, and win the battle to ensure their survival.
