  _levelDescription: Having escaped the Primordials' grasp, the Beastmen now face
    a perilous voyage across the sea to the continent of Alderon. As they land on
    the shores of Alderon, they find the Kingdom of Stormguard awaiting them, ready
    to defend their homeland from the new invaders. Command the Beastmen's warriors
    in a fierce battle against the Stormguard forces. Victory here will establish
    the Beastmen's foothold in Alderon and mark the beginning of their new struggle
    in this foreign land.
